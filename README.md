- The project comprises code for a library management system that includes a number of modules such as Edit, Refresh, Delete, and Search. All of the modules were created by us. The code has a reusability characteristic, as well as the ability to overcome time and space complexity. This code was written in Python 3, which makes it even better.

The project has a capability of taking the information of new books as input and storing them. This project also contains a reserved module for refreshing the status of a book. The project also has a capability to impose fine to the student when he returns the book late. This project also has a capability to search student information based on ID entered by the student. The add module and delete module loads in a new window that is specifically allotted further and even it prompts us while performing delete module.
